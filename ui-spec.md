## Screen 5: Pipeline Board (Kanban)

**Source:** `opportunities` JOIN `sales_stages`

Each card shows:
- Company name (from `companies`)
- Deal value (`deal_value`)
- Expected close date (`expected_close_date`)
- Deal age (`deal_age_days`) — red if > threshold
- Owner
- Forecast category badge

**Drag behavior:** Dragging a card to the next column triggers stage transition validation:
- System checks `sales_stages.required_fields` for target stage
- If missing fields → modal popup to complete them
- On success → write to `stage_transitions` log
- On fail → card snaps back, error shown

**Filters:** Owner, Forecast Category, Expected Close Date range

6. **Qualification Summary** — Read-only view from `qualification_checks`

## UI Principles

- Every field maps to a SQL column or derived view
- No freeform data entry outside defined fields
- Stage transitions are gated — UI enforces the schema constraints
- Dashboards are read-only — no editable metric fields
- Activity is always logged, never assumed
- Risk surfaces automatically — no one has to go looking for problems
